// publish them as seprate modules.

// The best way to keep this difference between your business logic
// code and your plugins, is to test the plugins separately as well.
// In this way you can be sure if a plugin is working correclty,
// and if something does not work in your application you can
// quickly understand that the problem is not the plugin itself,
// but how you are using it.
