/**
 * A typical usage of a plugin, is to expose an external service,
 * such as a database. In this case we are exposing the Elasticsearch client
 * since the application uses elasticsearch as a main datastore.
 * As you will see, inside this plugin we are not only exposing the
 * Elasticsearch instance, but also initializing the necessary indices.
 *
 * Protip: A rule of thumb to follow is that every plugin should be self-contained,
 * and initialize all of its resources before telling Fastify that is ready to go.
 * By design, Fastify won't start listening to incoming requests until all the registered
 * plugins have finished their loading. Fastify guarantees the loading order
 * thanks to an internal graph structure, provided by https://github.com/fastify/avvio.

  // on other onClose functions will be executed first,
