/**
 * Fastify tries not to impose any design decision on you, but we highly
 * recommend using the Fastify plugin system, as it gives you some neat features,
 * such as the load order and the guarantee that every part of your application
 * has been loaded before it starts listening to incoming requests.
 * See https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Plugins/.
 * For this reason routes and business logic should always wrapped inside plugins,
 * but you should never use `fastify-plugin` in this case, as you don't want to leak
 * your business logic or custom plugins to the rest of the application.
 *
 * As you will see the project structure is very boringâ„¢,
 * and this is on purpose. You don't need to think about how
 * anything should be done, it's that simple! Do you need to declare
 * a set of routes? Plugin! Do you want to wrap each domain of your
 * application in a different folder? Plugin! Do you need to interact with the
 * request/response? Hook! This means the function signature will be the same every time.
 * Why did we designed Fastify in this way? Because boring things are predictable.
 * You can have homogeneous or heterogeneous teams, and the result will always
 * be the same. The entry barrier in the codebase will be low and everyone
 * will be able to understand what's happening.
 *
 * It's always a good idea to expose a status route, so you can quickly
 * understand if your application is running and which version is deployed.
