// There are two main ways you can use to test your application,
// one is to test with a running server, which means that inside
// each test you will invoke `.listen()`, or with http injection.
// Http injection allows you to call routes of your server without
// the need to have a running http server underneath.
// Http injection is a first class citizen in Fastify, and you can
// use it both in production and testing.
//
// You can read more about testing and http injection at the following url:
// https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Testing/

  // The http injection feature is powered by https://github.com/fastify/light-my-request
  // and you can access it with `fastify.inject`. This method can be used with
  // both callbacks and promises, a successful result is any http response,
  // which can be a 2xx, 3xx, 4xx or 5xx, while it will return an error
  // in case of a bad configuration or if something goes wrong.
